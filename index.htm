                  Home to the <B>OpenSeries</B> of online sports simulations.
                  <br><br>
                  Within our virtual walls you can play any of our games, much like
                  any other sports simulation website. However we here at ClubPit don't 
                  believe in "them & us" when it comes to our game development. So
                  as well as playing our games, you can play a part in shaping their 
                  future. 
                  <BR><BR>
                  Our games are free for anyone
                  to download, change, improve or fix. You can run games on your own computer, 
                  for you and your friends to play completely free of charge. Why pay an annual
                  ransom to other game developers and not have any control of their game when
                  you can use the OpenSeries of games for free and be completely in control of
                  your game and your wallet?
                  <BR><BR>
                  At the moment we are still developing the OpenFootball game which will allow you
                  become the headcoach of a team, all from within your browser. No software to
                  download, no list of compatible operating systems. As long as you can connect
                  to the net, whether it be with your computer, your works computer, someone elses computer, 
                  your PDA or even your phone, you will be able to play OpenFootball.
                  <BR><BR>
                  And if you think being able to play football online from just a browser is a step ahead of
                  what everyone else is doing, think again. Were planning on moving the genre forward even further
                  by having your games played in real-time, with you calling the plays as they happen against your
                  fellow coaches and then watching your players on the pitch running those plays - all from within
                  your common browser. 
                  <br><br>
                  Cheers,
                  <br><br>
